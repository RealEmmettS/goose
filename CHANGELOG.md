# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); the project will adopt
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) once it produces releasable artifacts.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Cargo workspace + `honk-engine` crate (milestone M0)** — the platform-free
  simulation core: `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, no windowing/OS/audio/input dependency,
  fully headless-testable. Ported 1:1 from the verified modding-API source
  (`…/GooseModdingAPI/{Exports.cs, SamEngine.cs}`): `Vec2` + `SamMath`; the 120 Hz
  fixed-timestep constants (`DT = 1/120`); the **faithful biased** `Deck` shuffle-bag
  (decision C8 — a seedable SplitMix64 drives it for deterministic tests; RNG internals
  are clean-room); `GooseEntity` + `ParametersTable` at the verified values (Walk/Run/
  Charge 80/200/400, accel 1300/2300, step 0.2/0.1, mud 15); the rig geometry constants
  with a clean-room `update_rig`; `ProceduralFeet`; the 64-slot `FootMarks` ring buffer
  (lifetime 8.5 s / shrink 1 s); and a clean-room tiny-skia renderer (`Rig → Pixmap`
  with a dirty-rect bounding box). Pinned by 26 unit tests (constants, rig vertices, the
  exact `Deck` sequence + its documented bias, footmark lifetimes) and 3 committed
  golden-frame PNGs. The renderer's proportions are a first clean-room approximation —
  the goldens are a regression baseline, not a fidelity reference (visual tuning is M1+).
- **Workspace scaffold** — root `Cargo.toml` (workspace, edition 2021 / Rust 1.95 via
  `[workspace.package]`, `[profile.dist]`), `rust-toolchain.toml` pinned to 1.95, and
  `crates/honk-engine/Cargo.toml`. The `[workspace.metadata.dist]` / WiX / CI blocks are
  intentionally deferred to the M19 packaging round. Local gate is green
  (`fmt --check`, `clippy -D warnings`, `test --workspace`, `build --release`).
- `honk300_plan.md` — **the canonical, authoritative plan.** A claim-tested *hybrid* that
  synthesizes `claude_plan.md` (structural spine) and `codex_plan.md` (grafts), then folds in an
  approved round of new scope. Each draft's load-bearing claims were verified against ground
  truth: engine constants checked against `…/GooseModdingAPI/Exports.cs` (claude exact; codex's
  Appendix-B speeds wrong), the biased `Deck` against `SamEngine.cs`, and the QubeTX conventions
  (editions, the 6 base targets, `cargo-dist 0.31.0`, ICE flags) across TR300/ND300/WB300. Adds:
  the new autonomous behaviors, a ratatui `<name> config` TUI, a three-name goose-speak CLI, and
  a full all-OS/all-arch build matrix. Build milestones now **M0–M19**.
- `claude_plan.md` — comprehensive, adversarially-reviewed plan for **honk300**, a
  cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux) Rust reimplementation of Desktop Goose. Derived
  from analysis of `DESKTOP-GOOSE/` (the original v0.31 Windows + v0.22 macOS builds) and
  the `*300` sibling repos (TR300/ND300/WB300). Captures the reverse-engineered engine
  (rig geometry + physics constants, 120 Hz fixed tick, the biased `Deck` shuffle-bag, the
  Task/`InjectionPoints` model from `…/GooseModdingAPI/{SamEngine,Exports}.cs`), a
  Cargo-workspace architecture (`honk-engine` + capability-trait platform backends), build
  milestones M0–M17, the packaging pipeline (cargo-dist + hand-authored
  `windows-installers.yml`), a per-platform capability matrix, and a ranked risk table.
- `codex_plan.md` — a parallel planning document produced by Codex.
- `CHANGELOG.md` / `HUMAN_CHANGELOG.md` — dual changelogs, mirroring the `*300` family
  convention.
- `CLAUDE.md` — repository guidance for future Claude Code sessions.

### Changed
- `claude_plan.md` and `codex_plan.md` are now **superseded reference drafts**; `honk300_plan.md`
  is canonical. The "Read these first" pointers in **both** `CLAUDE.md` and its Codex twin
  `AGENTS.md` were updated in lockstep (canonical plan, milestone range M0–M19, workspace
  cross-reference → `honk300_plan.md` §7).
- `README.md` gained a **"Status — the decided plan"** section recording `honk300_plan.md` as
  canonical and summarizing the decided direction (three-name goose-speak CLI, ratatui config
  TUI, new autonomous behaviors, no external mods / no tray, all-OS/all-arch builds).

### Decided
- **Three invocation names** (`honk300` / `honk` / `goose`) with a finite, deterministic
  "goose-speak" grammar (e.g. `goose plz` to start, `honk bad` / `goose no honk` to stop,
  `goose do honk` to poke, `<name> config`, `<name> help`) — a fixed phrase map, **not** runtime
  NL parsing.
- **TOML config** (`config.toml`) replacing the original `.ini`, original keys preserved at the
  verified values, versioned + tolerant loader.
- **No external mod system** (no DLL/WASM/data mods). Autumn becomes a **built-in** season/task;
  extensibility is via documented internal seams (`ARCHITECTURE.md` + rustdoc).
- **No system tray.** Quit via hold-ESC (where the OS allows) or any stop command, over a new
  **single-instance + IPC command channel** (`stop` / `do` / `reload`) that is also the
  Wayland-safe quit and the TUI's hot-apply transport.
- A **ratatui** config TUI at `<name> config` (QubeTX-family architecture: reducer + crossterm +
  `tokio::select!`) toggling every behavior incl. Autumn; **hot-apply where cheap, restart-note
  otherwise**.
- **New autonomous behaviors** (each a toggle, scoped to parameter-modulation of the procedural
  rig — no new art): dynamic moods, seasonal moods, multi-monitor chase, on-the-hour double honk,
  perch-&-ride windows, hover-sweep pat streak + hearts, quiet-hours/DND-fullscreen respect, a
  Calm-goose valve, and manual poke commands. Default = full prank, always-on.
- **Build for every advertised OS and architecture:** Windows x64 **and ARM64**, macOS Intel
  **and Apple Silicon** (universal2 `.app`/`.dmg`), Linux x64 **and ARM** (gnu + musl) — arch is a
  build/packaging axis, capability is an OS/display-server axis (`Cap<T>`).
- App name **honk300** (binary `honk300`, optional `honk` alias); fresh permanent WiX/Inno
  GUIDs (never reuse the sibling repos').
- Clean-room **procedural** goose renderer — no sprite extraction. Original sound effects
  bundled 1:1 (personal use); meme images **regenerated originally** via an
  `Assets/Images/Memes/codex.md` brief (not copied); notepad messages **authored fresh**
  (not paraphrased).
- Linux: **X11-first** (runs under XWayland on Wayland sessions); native Wayland behind an
  opt-in `--wayland` flag with reduced mischief.
- Distribution: Windows-first installer matrix (Global/Corporate × MSI/EXE) + shell/
  PowerShell installers + macOS `.app`/`.dmg` + Linux `.desktop`. **No crates.io** —
  `crates-publish.yml` intentionally dropped from the family pipeline.

### Notes
- No `Cargo.toml` / `src/` exists yet — implementation is a later round (starts at plan
  milestone M0). `DESKTOP-GOOSE/` is **reference-only** and contains third-party
  copyrighted assets that are not for redistribution.
