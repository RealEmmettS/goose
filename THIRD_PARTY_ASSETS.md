# Third-Party and User-Supplied Assets

The PolyForm Noncommercial license in `LICENSE` covers honk300's project-authored source code, documentation, and project-authored media. It does not relicense assets owned by other people.

## Personal-use compatibility assets

The following directories contain screened compatibility media retained at the project owner's direction for personal-use builds:

- `Assets/Sounds/`
- `Assets/Images/Memes/originals/`
- `Assets/Text/NotepadMessages/originals/`

Those files remain copyright their respective owners. honk300 does not assert ownership of them or grant redistribution, commercial-use, trademark, publicity, or other rights beyond rights the recipient already has. Anyone redistributing a build is responsible for confirming permission or replacing/removing these files.

The screening record in `Assets/Images/Memes/originals/SCREENING.md` is part of this notice. Material containing old donation links, Patreon references, social handles, or old-developer promotion is intentionally excluded.

## Project-authored counterparts

Media under these directories was created specifically for honk300 and is covered by the project's license unless a file says otherwise:

- `Assets/Images/Memes/custom/`
- `Assets/Text/NotepadMessages/custom/`

Generation prompts and provenance notes are kept beside the custom meme assets.

## User-supplied media

`Assets/Images/Memes/user/Meme8.png` was supplied and approved by the project owner. Its underlying rights were not independently audited; downstream distributors must make their own permission determination.

Runtime user media stored in a user's honk300 data directory remains that user's content and is never relicensed by honk300.

## Dependencies

Rust crates and build tools retain their own licenses. Their inclusion does not change those terms. Release archives must include this notice and the root `LICENSE` file.

### Vendored Wayland scanner backport

`vendor/wayland-scanner/` contains the MIT-licensed crates.io `wayland-scanner` 0.31.10 source.
Its included `LICENSE.txt` remains authoritative. honk300 updates only its `quick-xml` dependency
and corresponding parser call to carry the security fix from upstream wayland-rs revision
`d07c4f91f28b42e5a485823ffd9d8d5a210b1053` without adopting that revision's unreleased breaking
Wayland API changes. Full provenance and removal criteria are in
`vendor/wayland-scanner/UPSTREAM.md`.
